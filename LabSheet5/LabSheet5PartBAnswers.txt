Q1:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main() {

	double* d = new double[3]; //array was not given an actual size.

	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		d[i] = 1.5 + i;
	}

	for (int i = 2; i >= 0; i--) {
		cout << d[i] << endl;
	} //using Unsigned int causes it to loop indefinitely
	
	delete[] d;//Not deleted, will result in issues with memory later on

	return 0;
}

Q2:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;//iostream wasn't imported and given namespace

int main()
{
	char chr = 'N';
	if (chr == 'Y' || chr == 'y') { //is a non-zero constant second character wasn't being equated to variable
		cout << "chr is y" << endl;
	}
	else if (chr == 'N' || chr == 'n'){ //is a non-zero constant second character wasn't being equated to variable
		cout << "chr is n" << endl;
	} else {
		cout << "chr is something else" << endl;
	}
	return 0; //program was returning "chr is y" as the if wasn't comparing the variable right
}

Q3:

Q4:Both will Loop endlessly as there is no way for the loop to progress as the "int count = 1;" set's the count variable back to 1 meaning it will never increment to above 5.
The first loop iterates at the start of the next iteration while the second loop iterates right before the end of the iteration.
